        Jenga Game
      </h2></span>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp
        Jenga is a game of physical skill created by Leslie Scott, and currently marketed by Hasbro. Players take turns
        removing one block at a time from a tower constructed of 54 blocks. Each block removed is then placed on top
        of the tower, creating a progressively taller and more unstable structure.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules and guidlines</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To set up the game, the included loading tray is used to stack the initial tower which has eighteen levels
          of three blocks placed adjacent to one another along their long side and at right angles to the previous
          level
          (so, for example, if the blocks in the first level lie lengthwise north-south, the second-level blocks will
          lie east-west).</li>
        <li>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower gets the first move.</li>
        <li>Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any level (except the one below the
          incomplete top level)
          of the tower, and placing it on the topmost level to complete it.</li>
        <li>Only one hand should be used at a time when taking blocks from the tower. Blocks may be bumped to find a
          loose block that
          will not disturb the rest of the tower.</li>
        <li>Any block that is moved out of place must be returned to its original location before removing another
          block.
          The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower or after ten seconds, whichever occurs first.</li>
        <li>The game ends when the tower falls, or if any piece falls from the tower other than the piece being knocked
          out
          to move to the top. The winner is the last person to successfully remove and place a block.</li>

      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp
        It is one of the oldest and most played traditional Game in Meghalaya especially in khasi community.To play
        five stones game minimum two players are required. Maximum number of players can be of any number, but
        generally
        played in a small group. This game is more popular among the girls rather than the boys. Children in the age
        group
        of 6 to 8 years (and also above) mostly play this game.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules and guidlines</h3>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp In this game, the players need to complete a set of nine steps and these steps are as given below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The player has to closely scatter all five stones on the ground and has to pick up one of those and again
          has to
          throw up in the air. The player should not allow the pebble to fall on the ground and before catching the
          pebble in
          the air she needs to pick up one of the stones from the ground and then catch the first one in air. This has
          to be
          done very swiftly. In this way, one by one the other three pebbles are also required to pick up.</li>
        <li>The player has to scatter all the five the stones on the ground and from there has to pick one of the
          pebbles
          like first step and needs to throw in the air. Like the previous step, this time also the player should not
          allow
          the first pebble to fall on the ground and before catching that pebble in the 17 air the player needs to pick
          up
          two stones at a time from the ground. In this way the other two stones also need to be picked up.</li>
        <li>Game rules remain same as in previous step, but this time the player needs to pick up three stones at a
          time
          from the ground. The last one has to be picked up like step one. </li>
        <li>Game rules remain same as in previous step, but this time the player needs to pick up all the four stones
          from the ground at a time.
        <li>Player has to hold all the five stones in one hand and then needs to throw one stone among them up in the
          air and before catching that stone, the other four stones need to be kept on the ground quickly. Then again
          has to throw that stone up in the air and needs to pick up all four stones at a time from the ground and then
          needs to
          catch the stone in the air.</li>
        <li>The player has to make an arc with the middle finger and thumb, where the index finger has to be twisted
          over the middle finger.
          That finger arc is horizontally placed on the ground. The other two fingers have to be just lifted. After
          that, the player
          needs to scatter the pebbles on the ground in front of the finger arc. Any of the opponent players has to
          point to a
          particular pebble out of the five, which is not to be touched till the end of this step. Generally, the
          opponent player
          points to such a stone that causes difficulty to the player while playing this step. The player has to pick
          another
          pebble and needs to throw it up in the air and before catching the stone the player has to swipe one of the
          stones
          through the arc. Like this three chances are given to the player for every stone to pass through the arc.
          While swiping,
          the player must be cautious enough for not touching the other stones. In this way the player has to swipe all
          the three stones leaving the one that is selected by the opponent. At the end, after swiping all the three
          stones, the player
          has to swipe the last one, which was selected by the opponent.</li>
        <li>The player has to hold all the five stones in her hand and need to throw any of the stones up in the air
          and has to keep the
          other four stones on the ground before catching the stone thrown in the air. After that, one of the opponent
          players has to select
          one stone from the four stones placed on the ground. Then the player again has to throw the stone in hand to
          the air and before
          catching it quickly needs to pick up three stones at a time, but without touching the selected one.</li>
        <li>The player has to throw all the five stones up in the air and then needs to catch them by flipping the
          hand and holding them with the dorsal of the hands. Out of those stones the player needs to hold one stone
          in between two fingers and letting the rest to fall on the ground. After that, the stone in between the
          fingers
          needs to throw up in the air and then the player has to pick up the stones on the ground swiftly at a time
          before
          catching the stone in the air. </li>
        <li>In the last step of this game, the player has to throw up the five stones in the air and needs to catch all
          the stones
          with the dorsal side of the hand. Again, in this holding position the stones are to be thrown in the air and
          have to catch
          them with front side of the hands. If any player misses any of the steps then the second player takes the
          turn. The second
          player plays the game until she misses any step. Like this the game continues. The player in their second
          round can play
          the step she missed in the previous round. The player who completed all the steps in minimum trials is the
          winner.</li>
